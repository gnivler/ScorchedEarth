# ScorchedEarth
BattleTech ModTek mod.  Improves scorch and step decal application and persistence

   * All decals (scorches, footsteps) are now permanent instead of fading away after 40 seconds
   * The state of the battlefield is now saved, so the decals are in their proper place upon loading (new in 3.0)
   * The limit for decals is increased from 125 to 1000
   * Overlapping decals are optimized
   * There is no performance impact even on lower-end systems
   * mod.json has two settings but the defaults will be fine for most people
